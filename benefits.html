            <p>OVERVIEW</p>
            <p>You may have heard that experts recommend adults get 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75
                minutes of vigorous activity each week. Swimming is an excellent way to work your entire body
                and cardiovascular system. An hour of swimming burns almost as many calories as running, without
                all the impact on your bones and joints. These are the host of benefits you may gain from swimming.</p>
